    "Test": " The image captures a scene that appears to be in the process of being photographed. There's a camera flash reflected on the ceiling, indicating that a picture is being taken. Below the reflective surface, we can see two circular objects, possibly lights or lamps, each with a distinct pattern: one has a checkered design, and the other has a grid-like pattern. The objects are mounted on a rectangular surface that resembles a ceiling tile. The background of the image is not clearly visible due to the angle at which it's taken. "
