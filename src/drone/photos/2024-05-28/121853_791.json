    "Test": " The image displays a ceiling view of a room with a white tiled floor. Two round lights are visible, one on the left and another on the right side of the frame. A large air duct is noticeable in the center, running across the length of the ceiling. The lighting fixtures appear modern and minimalistic, fitting into the contemporary design aesthetic. There is a slight tilt or distortion at the bottom edge of the photo that seems to have been applied digitally, giving the image an unnatural perspective. "
