    "Test": " The image shows a person looking up at the ceiling, which is adorned with circular light fixtures and appears to have a textured surface. The individual seems engaged in observing something on the ceiling. In front of the person, there's a blurred area that suggests an object or part of a room, but it's not clear due to the focus being on the ceiling. The overall scene is indoors, and the person is standing at what could be a desk or counter. "
