    "Test": " The image shows an interior space, likely a room or a small office. There are three circular elements on the wall, which could be lights or decorations. Two of these elements are closer to each other and appear to have a different texture compared to the third one, which is positioned further away. A round ceiling light is turned off and situated towards the bottom center of the image. On the left side, there's an open door revealing another space with a carpeted floor and some objects on it, but not enough detail to identify what they are. The lighting in the room suggests it might be daytime. "
