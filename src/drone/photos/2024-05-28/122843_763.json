    "Test": " The image displays a close-up view of what appears to be the ceiling of an interior space, likely a public area given the presence of a fire sprinkler. The ceiling features a pattern of small light fixtures and perforated metal panels with circular cutouts, allowing for visibility into other areas. On the right side of the image, there is a vertical column partially visible, suggesting the structure may be made from metal or a similar material. A circular object resembling a light fixture or a decorative element hangs above the floor level. The overall appearance of the ceiling suggests a modern and possibly industrial design aesthetic. "
