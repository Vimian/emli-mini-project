    "Test": " The image depicts an interior space with a modern design aesthetic. On the left, there is a large piece of artwork, possibly a painting or sculpture, mounted on a dark wall. Adjacent to this artwork, on the right, are two circular light fixtures that appear to be part of a contemporary lighting installation. These lights cast soft illumination across the surface of the artwork and onto the floor. The overall ambiance suggests a well-lit and thoughtfully designed environment, perhaps within an art gallery or modern exhibition space. "
