    "Test": " The image shows a view looking up at the ceiling of a room, which is adorned with white tiles. There are three circular light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, one in the middle and two others on either side. Two round objects resembling smoke detectors or speakers are mounted on the wall above the lights. The lighting fixture in the center is the most prominent, drawing attention due to its size and central position within the frame of the photo. The overall ambiance suggests a modern and clean interior space. "
