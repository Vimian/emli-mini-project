    "Test": " The image shows a close-up view of an interior space, possibly a room or an area within a building. There's an interesting perspective where the angle captures two lights on opposite sides of the frame. In the center of the photo, there's a circular object that seems to be a light fixture, with its illuminated bulb casting a warm glow. The surrounding environment is blurred out due to the depth of field used in the photograph. There is no text visible in the image. "
