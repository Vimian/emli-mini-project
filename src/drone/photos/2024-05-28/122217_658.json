    "Test": " The image shows an indoor space, specifically the ceiling of a room. There are three circular light fixtures positioned in a triangular formation, each casting light onto the black surface below them. Each fixture has a single, round illumination that is turned on. In the background, there is a partial view of what appears to be a structure with a patterned design, and two round, white-rimmed objects resembling frying pans are hanging from the ceiling. The ambiance suggests a modern or contemporary interior design style. "
