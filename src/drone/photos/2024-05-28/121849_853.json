    "Test": " The image shows a ceiling view of an interior space, which appears to be a room with some sort of ventilation or ductwork overhead. There are two circular objects hanging from the ceiling, possibly lights or decorations, and they are white in color. The floor is not fully visible, but there's a sense of it being tiled or covered by some material. A patterned ceiling can be seen above the circular objects, and the walls seem to have a textured appearance. The image has a faded quality and appears to be taken from an angle rather than straight-on, which gives it a slightly distorted perspective. "
