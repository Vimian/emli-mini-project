    "Test": " The image showcases an interior space, possibly a public area given the architectural elements. There are two circular lights mounted on what appears to be a wall or column, positioned symmetrically from each other and providing a contrast of warm light (on) versus cooler light (off). The space is illuminated by these lights, casting a soft glow that highlights the modern design of the structure. In the background, there's a glimpse of what seems to be a ceiling with exposed ductwork or perhaps an industrial-style aesthetic. "
